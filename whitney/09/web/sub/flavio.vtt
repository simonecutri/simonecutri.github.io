Flavio


00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.800
First I'll qualify this Im not the worlds best roommate by any measure.


00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.500
But having some terrible roommates in the past has at the very


00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.800
least made me aware of what you shouldnt do when youre cohabiting


00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.500
with someone smoothie incident notwithstanding.


00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.800
I do make an effort to treat my roommates with the respect


00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.500
that I expect from them and thats definitely a win.


00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Nearly everyone Ive lived with is struggling through various states of arrested


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.700
development learning to be more adult and less petty about things.


00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.400
And well get there eventuallyat which point well probably be making enough

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.400
money to finally live on our own.
