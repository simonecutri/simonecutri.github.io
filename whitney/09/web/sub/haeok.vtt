00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.600
We were in Brooklyn and one of the guys


00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.900
we were traveling with woke up in the middle of


00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.400
the night with a strange drunk man passed out next


00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.700
to him says a travel writer who would rather go unnamed.


00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.600
Turns out the guy had forgotten both his key and


00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.900
his room number.


00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.200
When the intoxicated man went to the night clerk to


00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.500
sort things out he blurted out any number he could

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
think of and the front desk just gave him a

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
key no questions asked
