Janet

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.600
I had a roommate that was a hippie

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.500
She didn't shave, use deodorant, work out etc.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.600
Her parents dumped 500 into her bank account weekly.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.700
She never did laundry.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.000
Dishes including mine that she and the other suitemates would

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.300
use would end up growing ecosystems when left in the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.200
sink for weeks.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.500
I had to wash my dishes in the shower

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.600
and kept them in my room to avoid sharing.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.900
She would have weekly movie viewing parties on weekdays like

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.200
Tuesday and Wednesday in the living room with far more

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.500
people than should fit in that room until 2 AM

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.400
when I was trying to study or sleep.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.700
Pubes consistently everywhere in the bathroom.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.200
Mine were a different color so that eliminated that problem.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.500
She took fiber supplements and took the most massive shits

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.800
that left shit rings in the toilet after she flushed.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.100
Earning her the nickname Queen of Saturn

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.400
from me and my boyfriend.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.700
The final straw was when she left a used tampon

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.600
behind the toilet.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.900
Still don't understand how you miss throwing it out/dropping it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.800
into the toilet.
