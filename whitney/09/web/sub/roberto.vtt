Another story: A friend of mine was living with a girl he met on Craigslist, a nice liberal-arts-y type who was studying social work.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.800
She had two pet shih tzus a momma dog and the smallest puppy from a litter the momma had birthed months before.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.100
My friend and the roommate had been living together in relative peace for a while when one day he left

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.000
the door open while bringing in some stuff from Safeway.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.300
The momma dog ran out the front door and was quickly hit and killed by a neighbor's car.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.600
The cops came quickly and they forgot that they had left a POUND of weed out in the open.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.300
They used my security deposit on bail and the girl apparently snapped and had a mental breakdown of some sort.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.000
She accused me of being a cop because on my license I used to live on a street that ended with 'Court.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.900
So she apparently thought I lived in a courthouse or some shit.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.300
I noped out as soon as I could and found my own place.
