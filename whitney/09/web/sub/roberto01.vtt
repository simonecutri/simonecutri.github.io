00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.800
I was a subletting from this young couple in Queens.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.100
Everything was going decently well other than over hearing a


00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.400
few verbal fights between them.


00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.700
Then one day I get a call from the girls


00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.000
sister asking when I was going to be back at

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.300
the apartment because both of my roommates were in jail.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.600
Long story short it turned out that she assaulted him


00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.500
and he defended himself then they both called the cops on each other.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.800
(gasp) The cops came quickly and they forgot that they

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.100
had left a POUND of weed out in the open.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.400
They used my security deposit on bail and the girl

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.700
apparently snapped and had a mental breakdown of some sort.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.000
She accused me of being a cop because on my

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.700
license I used to live on a street that ended with Court.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.400
So she apparently thought I lived in a courthouse or some shit.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.700
I noped out as soon as I could and found

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.600
my own place.
