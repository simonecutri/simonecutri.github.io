00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.900
While looking for a place I went to look at

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.200
a place in East Williamsburg kinda near the Morgan L.


00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.500
It was a loft with about seven ramshackle bedrooms with


00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.800
eight roommates already some stacked on top of each other


00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.900
most of them closed off with cloth instead of doors
the whole place was probably about a 750sq ft.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.200
DRAMATIC MUSIC ON THE BACKGROUND The shower didn't work and

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.500
was made from a plastic water tank and some tubing

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.200
and was located in a closet along with two cats' litter boxes.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.500
The table in the main room was covered end to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.800
end with empties and then there were stacks of empties

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.500
near the windows and alongside the walls.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.800
When I asked the roommates what they did for fun

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.900
'93We drink a lot.'

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.200
The '93room'94 was a 5 foot high cubby box up

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.700
a step ladder with no door.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.600
They wanted 800 dollars a month for it.
