00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.001
Sarah

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.800
and had to rush to find a replacement.

00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:03.902
I once had one of my roommates move out on short notice

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.900
My other roommate found someone through her coworker 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.800
that needed a 3 month sublet. The girl came over 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.700
on 2 separate occasions to take a look at the apartment 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.200
and the room and decided that she wanted to move in everything seemed to be going smoothly.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.100
My first red flag was when she asked me the day before moving

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.000
in if it was okay for her to bring a large desk and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.300
small couch that she really didnt want to part with.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.200
Now my apartment is a loft so its pretty open feeling but its

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.500
not actually that big the bedrooms are tiny and it was obviously already fully furnished.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.400
I told her we could try and find room for it and she

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.300
assured me that if I ended up not being okay with it she

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600
would move them to storage.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.500
The next morning she came with movers to bring her bed dresser and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.400
the aforementioned furniture.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.300
The couch actually fit okay and we propped up the disassembled desk in

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.200
a corner a slight eyesore but not too in the way I could

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.900
live with it for a few months.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.800
Sublet girl left to get the rest of her personal belongs and my

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.300
roommate and I left for a friends barbecue for the day.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.200
What we came home to that night was surreal and terrifying I should

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.700
add that we ate a pot brownie and were super-duper stoned.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.600
When we entered we found what appeared the be the entire contents of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.900
another apartment in our apartment.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.800
gasp Tables stools chairs dressers a standing keyboard floor lamps table lamps full

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.700
length mirrors a full set of pots and pans plates and flatware a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.800
toaster oven and just boxes upon boxes of things.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.700
You could barely walk it was so cluttered.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.600
When we told her that she had brought way more stuff than we

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.300
agreed to she started insisting that she could make it all fit.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.200
Apparently she had planned on just getting rid of most of her furniture

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.100
but at the last minute realized it would be a waste of money

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.000
she seriously phrased it just like that so she had her dad help

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.100
her bring it all over while we were gone.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.000
I told her there was no way it would all fit and that

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.900
she would have to move the stuff into storage as she had previously

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.200
offered and she flipped out.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.100
She started screaming about how I thought I knew everything was generally very

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.200
rude and insulting telling me how I must have never lived with roommates before.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.100
As she became more aggressive I really started to freak out realizing I

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.200
was going to have to kick this girl out.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.100
I had to just leave the apartment at that point to avoid a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.200
full blown panic attack.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.100
When I came back I told her that this wasnt going to work

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.200
and she had to find somewhere else to live.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.100
She continued to be angry and aggressive screaming at me and throwing a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.200
fit but finally agreed to have all her stuff out by the next week.
